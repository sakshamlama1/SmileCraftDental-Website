    {
        question: "How often should I brush and floss?",
        answer: "It is very important that you brush twice a day. Once in the morning after you have had breakfast and again at night, before you go to sleep. We recommend that you use a soft bristle toothbrush and brush at a 45 degree angle to the gums. Flossing should be done once a day as it is just as important as brushing. Flossing removes trapped food from in between your teeth where your brush canʼt reach."

        question: "Are electric toothbrushes better than manual brushes?",

    {
        question: "Should I have teeth whitening before or after I have my teeth restored or replaced?",
        answer: (
            <>
              If you are considering <NavLink to="/services/cosmetic/teeth-whitening" className="faq-link">teeth whitening</NavLink>, then you should discuss this with us before we proceed with any restorative or major dental work. Whitening should be carried out first, so the artificial tooth or filling can be matched to the shade your teeth will be after your whitening procedure.

        question: "Why teeth crack even after taking good care of them?",
        answer: (
            <>
                <p>A cracked tooth can be caused by chewing or biting hard objects. You are more prone if you already have a heavily filled tooth. Old amalgam fillings predispose teeth to cracking. A tooth filled with amalgam stands a much higher chance of cracking than an unfilled tooth or a tooth filled with modern resin or ceramic materials.</p>
